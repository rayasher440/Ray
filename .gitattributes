FACING THE FACTS
****************

Your BMI is ${Math.round(BMI)}

A BMI under 18.5 is considered underweight
A BMI above 25 is considered overweight

Your ideal weight is ${Math.round(idealWeightKg)} kg
With a normal lifestyle you burn ${Math.round(dailyCalories)} calories a day

**********
DIET PLAN
**********

If you want to reach your ideal weight of ${Math.round(idealWeightKg)} kg:

Eat ${Math.round(dietCalories)} calories a day
For ${Math.round(dietWeeks)} weeks
